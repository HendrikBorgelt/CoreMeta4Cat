# CatCore

Catcore is a metadata collection for catalysis related research, which is intended to be developed into several schema's, such that we can harmonize Metadata representation of various research topics int the domain of catalysis.

As bepicted below, CatCore is devided into four major branches, Reaction, Synthesis, Characterisation and Simulation, each described with respective metadata terminology.
